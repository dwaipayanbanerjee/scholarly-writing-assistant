The convergence of a narrow software focus at IIT Kanpur and a transformative shift in global migration proved pivotal.  In 1965, as IIT Kanpur’s inaugural class graduated, President Lyndon Johnson’s landmark immigration reforms eased U.S. residency requirements for skilled workers, particularly from India.  Possessing advanced programming skills but facing limited opportunities within India's nascent computing industry, these graduates became highly sought after by American universities and companies.  U.S. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith’s enthusiastic proclamation that “of all the developments in India during the last few decades, Kanpur must have had the highest multiplier effect. The arrival of IBM 1620 was a great event,” now takes on a new meaning.  The unspoken truth: this “multiplier effect” largely benefited the United States, not India.  Scholars Charles Leslie and Robert Kargon contend that IIT Kanpur’s contributions to American computing far outweighed its impact on India’s technological development.

Thus, the IBM 1620's installation at IIT Kanpur, while catalyzing change in Indian industry, also highlighted a stark paradox: India cultivated computing talent, only to witness a massive “brain drain.”  IIT Kanpur’s emphasis on software aligned perfectly with the burgeoning needs of American companies in the 1960s and 70s.  Often called the “Indian MIT,” IIT Kanpur’s graduates transitioned seamlessly into American academia and industry, becoming integral to Silicon Valley firms, government initiatives like the Census Bureau, and foundational projects like ARPANET.  This migration exposed the structural weaknesses of India’s computing industry, which lacked the resources to retain its brightest minds. Consequently, IIT Kanpur graduates, while key contributors to global computing innovation, primarily contributed outside India.

IIT Kanpur also played a crucial role in the rise of global outsourcing giants like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys.  TCS founder F.C. Kohli forged strong ties with IIT Kanpur, learning programming on its IBM systems.  Early on, IIT Kanpur faculty member H.N. Mahabala served as a summer consultant for TCS, establishing a pipeline for graduates.  Similarly, Infosys founder Narayana Murthy’s first computing experience was on the IIT Kanpur IBM 1620. He later leveraged his network of MIT-trained Indian scientists to propel Infosys to global prominence.

By 1972, even Norman Dahl of MIT, a key architect of the Kanpur assistance program, recognized its inherent flaws.  He admitted their success in producing skilled computer engineers and programmers was overshadowed by their failure to anticipate their employment prospects, thus fueling the exodus:

“This situation results from the fact that thus far the IIT/K(anpur) has been an irrelevant factor in the industrial and social progress of India. At present the Institute is a kind of isolated island of academic excellence but not a part of the mainstream of India’s development… the faculty must…generate a new type of capital…in terms of application of its intellectual capital to India’s problems. The IIT/K will not continue to receive special support…unless it also concerns itself with problems which matter to India…in the context of the new mood…of confidence and emphasis on self-reliance; IIT/K will have to earn any special treatment it receives.”

Dahl's “new mood” of self-reliance transcended mere nationalism; it reflected Bhabha and his TIFR colleagues’ vision for Indian computing.  Inherited by Menon, this vision centered on building domestic technological capabilities through public institutions, emphasizing expertise in both hardware manufacturing and advanced research as cornerstones of technological independence.

This vision contrasted sharply with the software-centric model that emerged at IIT Kanpur under IBM’s influence.  While IIT Kanpur produced skilled programmers and computer scientists, it prioritized software development and computer usage over hardware innovation. This divergence, coupled with TIFR’s growing influence on government policy, would shape the impending clash between India's scientific establishment and IBM.
