While the IBM 1620 appeared successful in Kanpur, significant technical and economic challenges simmered beneath the surface.  Upon its arrival in India, the 1620 was already technologically outdated, superseded in the United States by the advanced IBM 7000 series—a generational leap in computing architecture.  Consequently, India's leading scientific institutions were equipped with machines a generation behind the global state-of-the-art. This technology transfer pattern, where IBM shipped older models to India at inflated prices, often disguised as loans or outright sales, revealed a troubling dynamic.  Profitable for IBM, this arrangement allowed the company to offload aging inventory while securing a foothold in a growing technology market.  However, IBM's gains came at a cost to Indian computing development. The 1620's limitations significantly impacted computing education in India.  IBM's prohibition against hardware modification prevented Indian researchers and students from exploring machine design and hardware engineering.  Consequently, the focus shifted solely to programming and software development—the only avenue for experimentation and learning.  This emphasis, while foundational to India's later triumphs in software and IT services, simultaneously narrowed technical expertise during a period of rapid global integration of hardware and software development.
