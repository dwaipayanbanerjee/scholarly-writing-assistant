TIFR's vision of developing home-grown scientific leadership in national policy stemmed largely from their growing unease about IBM's increasing influence in Indian computing. While TIFR strove to build domestic technical expertise, IBM continued expanding its footprint across Indian institutions. The IBM 1620 installation at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur exemplified this parallel development most dramatically. Earlier, we explored TIFR's attempts to secure USAID funding for a CDC computer through direct appeals to Kenneth Galbraith, the U.S. Ambassador to India. Unknown to TIFR at the time, Galbraith was simultaneously orchestrating the placement of an IBM machine at IIT Kanpur. Significantly, the IBM 1620's installation in July 1963 coincided with the arrival of TIFR's CDC 3600.
