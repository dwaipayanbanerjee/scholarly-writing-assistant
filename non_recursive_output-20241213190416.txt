The convergence of a narrow software focus at IIT Kanpur and a transformative moment in global migration proved significant.  In 1965, as IIT Kanpur’s inaugural class graduated, President Lyndon Johnson’s landmark immigration reforms eased U.S. residency requirements for skilled workers, particularly from India.  With advanced programming skills but limited opportunities in India's nascent computing industry, these graduates became highly sought after by American universities and companies.  U.S. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith’s enthusiastic claim that “of all the developments in India during the last few decades, Kanpur must have had the highest multiplier effect. The arrival of IBM 1620 was a great event,” thus takes on a new meaning. The unspoken reality: this “multiplier effect” primarily benefited the United States, not India.  Scholars Charles Leslie and Robert Kargon argue that IIT Kanpur contributed far more to American computing than to India’s own technological advancement.

Consequently, the IBM 1620’s installation at IIT Kanpur, while catalyzing developments in Indian industry, underscored a paradox: India cultivated computing talent, only to lose it to a massive “brain drain.”  IIT Kanpur’s emphasis on software aligned perfectly with the needs of rapidly expanding American companies in the 1960s and 1970s.  Often dubbed the “Indian MIT,” IIT Kanpur produced graduates who seamlessly transitioned into American academia and industry, becoming integral to U.S. institutions and projects, from Silicon Valley firms and government initiatives like the Census Bureau to foundational computing projects like ARPANET.  This migration exposed the structural weaknesses of India’s computing industry, which lacked the resources to retain its talent. Ultimately, IIT Kanpur graduates became key contributors to global computing innovation, but primarily outside India.

IIT Kanpur also played a pivotal role in the rise of global outsourcing giants like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys. TCS founder F.C. Kohli forged strong connections with IIT Kanpur, learning programming on its IBM systems. In TCS's early years, IIT Kanpur faculty member H. N. Mahabala served as a summer consultant, creating a pipeline for graduates.  Similarly, Infosys founder Narayana Murthy gained his first computing experience on IIT Kanpur’s IBM 1620, later leveraging his network of MIT-trained Indian scientists to transform Infosys into a global leader.

By 1972, even Norman Dahl of MIT, a key architect of the Kanpur assistance program, acknowledged its flaws. He conceded their success in producing skilled computer engineers and programmers, but admitted their failure to consider their future employment, leading to the mass exodus:

“This situation results from the fact that thus far the IIT/K(anpur) has been an irrelevant factor in the industrial and social progress of India. At present the Institute is a kind of isolated island of academic excellence but not a part of the mainstream of India’s development… the faculty must make a change towards generating a new type of capital which is gathered not in terms of published papers or academic excellence but in terms of application of its intellectual capital to India’s problems. The IIT/K will not continue to receive special support from Indian society unless it also concerns itself with problems which matter to India. This is particularly true in the context of the new mood in the country of confidence and emphasis on self-reliance; IIT/K will have to earn any special treatment it receives.”

The “new mood” of self-reliance Dahl referenced transcended mere nationalism; it embodied Bhabha and his TIFR colleagues’ comprehensive vision for Indian computing. Inherited by Menon, this vision centered on building domestic technological capabilities through public institutions, emphasizing expertise in both hardware manufacturing and advanced research as essential foundations for India's technological independence. This vision contrasted sharply with the software-focused model that emerged at IIT Kanpur under IBM's influence.  While IIT Kanpur successfully produced programmers and computer scientists, it prioritized software development and computer usage over hardware innovation. This divergence, coupled with TIFR’s growing influence over Indian government policy, would shape the coming confrontation between India’s scientific establishment and IBM.
