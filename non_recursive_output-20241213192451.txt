In December 1968, the Electronics Committee commissioned a third report from Narasimhan, who led the TIFRAC and CDC-3600 projects. His findings reinforced and expanded upon the concerns raised in the earlier Bhabha and Rao reports. He noted that most IBM machines in India were refurbished units from the United States, primarily handling basic data processing for private and government organizations. With the sole exception of IIT Kanpur's IBM 7044, these machines were inadequate for scientific research. The report concluded that India remained disconnected from the global computer revolution, as these privately owned, outdated machines neither fostered 'computer consciousness' nor advanced the nation's scientific research.

The Committee proposed a dual approach to counter IBM's market dominance. They advocated for significant government investment in versatile, public-access computers suitable for multiple applications, including theoretical research. Additionally, they pushed for government support to develop domestic manufacturing capabilities. Drawing from lessons learned during the TIFRAC project, the Committee acknowledged a challenging reality: India's resource and technical limitations made it difficult to manufacture all computer components domestically, necessitating some international procurement.

However, the Committee established a crucial principle: India must maintain control over domestic 'systems engineering'â€”the assembly and integration of components. While importing parts was acceptable, losing the expertise to build cutting-edge machines was not. Without this strategic approach, the Committee cautioned, India would face severe consequences: the loss of domestic computer manufacturing potential, decreased employment opportunities for electronics and computer technology specialists, and the inability to utilize sophisticated hardware produced by local industry. They emphasized that each year of inaction would compound these losses.
