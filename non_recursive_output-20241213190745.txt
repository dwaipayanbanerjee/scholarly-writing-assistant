The focus on software at IIT Kanpur coincided with a pivotal moment in global migration. In 1965, the institute's first graduating class entered the workforce just as President Lyndon Johnson's sweeping immigration reforms eased U.S. residency requirements for skilled workers from nations like India. Armed with advanced programming skills but facing limited opportunities in India's fledgling computing sector, IIT Kanpur graduates became highly desirable to American universities and companies. Against this backdrop, U.S. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith’s exuberant assertion—"Of all the developments in India during the last few decades, Kanpur must have had the highest multiplier effect. The arrival of IBM 1620 was a great event"—gains a layered significance. The harsh, unspoken truth was that this "multiplier effect" overwhelmingly benefited the United States instead of India. Scholars Charles Leslie and Robert Kargon argue that IIT Kanpur contributed far more to the advancement of American computing than to India's own technological growth. 

The installation of the IBM 1620 at IIT Kanpur drove significant changes in Indian industry but also highlighted its paradoxical outcome: India nurtured exceptional computing talent only to see it drained away by an overwhelming "brain drain." The institution’s emphasis on software aligned seamlessly with the demands of American companies rapidly scaling their software capabilities during the 1960s and 1970s. Often referred to as the "Indian MIT," IIT Kanpur consistently produced graduates who transitioned effortlessly into American academia and the tech industry. They became instrumental in U.S. initiatives, working with Silicon Valley firms, government bodies like the Census Bureau, and foundational projects such as ARPANET. This pattern starkly exposed the systemic deficiencies within India’s embryonic computing sector, which lacked the infrastructure to retain its talent. As a result, IIT Kanpur alumni became prominent contributors to global computing developments, yet their most notable achievements occurred outside India. 

Despite this drain, IIT Kanpur profoundly influenced the rise of global IT giants like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys. TCS founder F.C. Kohli forged meaningful connections with the institute, gaining early programming experience on its IBM systems. During TCS’s early days, H.N. Mahabala, an IIT Kanpur faculty member, worked with the company as a summer consultant, helping establish a direct pipeline for graduates to join TCS. Similarly, Infosys founder Narayana Murthy encountered computing for the first time on IIT Kanpur's IBM 1620. Leveraging a network of MIT-trained Indian scientists, he later transformed Infosys into a global powerhouse. 

By 1972, even Norman Dahl of MIT, a lead architect of the Kanpur assistance program, recognized its shortcomings. He admitted that while the program had successfully produced a cadre of skilled engineers and programmers, it had failed to account for where these graduates would find meaningful employment, resulting in widespread emigration. Dahl observed: 

"This situation results from the fact that thus far the IIT/K(anpur) has been an irrelevant factor in the industrial and social progress of India. At present, the Institute is a kind of isolated island of academic excellence but not a part of the mainstream of India’s development... the faculty must make a change towards generating a new type of capital which is gathered not in terms of published papers or academic excellence but in terms of application of its intellectual capital to India’s problems. The IIT/K will not continue to receive special support from Indian society unless it also concerns itself with problems which matter to India. This is particularly true in the context of the new mood in the country of confidence and emphasis on self-reliance; IIT/K will have to earn any special treatment it receives." 

The "new mood" of self-reliance Dahl mentioned extended beyond simple nationalism. It embodied the comprehensive vision of Homi Bhabha and his colleagues at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), which prioritized building India’s technological capabilities through public institutions. This vision, later championed by M.G.K. Menon, emphasized proficiency in both hardware manufacturing and advanced research, considering these essential for achieving technological self-sufficiency. 

This perspective stood in sharp contrast to the model that had emerged at IIT Kanpur under IBM’s influence. While IIT Kanpur excelled in producing programmers and computer scientists, its emphasis remained firmly on software development and application rather than hardware innovation. The divergence between these two approaches, coupled with TIFR’s growing authority over Indian government policy, set the stage for an eventual conflict between India’s scientific establishment and IBM.
