The installation of the IBM 1620 at IIT Kanpur catalyzed transformative developments in Indian industry but revealed a paradox: India cultivated computing talent only to lose it through a massive "brain drain." IIT Kanpur's strong emphasis on software skills perfectly matched the needs of American companies, which were rapidly expanding their software capabilities during the 1960s and 1970s. Often dubbed the "Indian MIT," IIT Kanpur produced graduates who seamlessly transitioned into American academia and industry. These graduates became integral to U.S. institutions and projects, including Silicon Valley firms, government initiatives like the Census Bureau, and foundational computing projects such as ARPANET. This migration highlighted the structural weaknesses of India’s nascent computing industry, which lacked the resources and infrastructure to retain talent. Consequently, IIT Kanpur graduates became key contributors to global computing innovation, primarily outside India.

By 1972, Norman Dahl of MIT, a key architect of the Kanpur assistance program, acknowledged its fundamental flaws. He conceded that while they succeeded in producing skilled computer engineers and programmers, they failed to consider where these talents would find employment after graduation, leading to a mass exodus:

"This situation results from the fact that thus far the IIT Kanpur has been an irrelevant factor in the industrial and social progress of India. At present, the Institute is an isolated island of academic excellence but not part of the mainstream of India’s development... The faculty must shift towards generating a new type of capital, not through published papers or academic excellence, but by applying its intellectual capital to India’s problems. IIT Kanpur will not continue to receive special support from Indian society unless it addresses issues that matter to India. This is particularly true in the context of the new mood in the country emphasizing confidence and self-reliance; IIT Kanpur must earn any special treatment it receives."

The "new mood" of self-reliance that Dahl referenced represented more than nationalist sentiment—it embodied Bhabha and his TIFR colleagues’ comprehensive vision for Indian computing. This vision, inherited by Menon, focused on building domestic technological capabilities through public institutions. They emphasized developing expertise in both hardware manufacturing and advanced research, viewing these as essential for India's technological independence.

This vision sharply contrasted with the model that had emerged at IIT Kanpur under IBM's influence. While IIT Kanpur successfully produced skilled programmers and computer scientists, its focus remained primarily on software development and computer usage rather than hardware innovation. The divergence between these two approaches, along with TIFR's growing influence over Indian government policy, would shape the upcoming confrontation between India's scientific establishment and IBM.
