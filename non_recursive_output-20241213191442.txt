The installation of the IBM 1620 at IIT Kanpur catalyzed transformative developments in Indian industry but also underscored a paradox: India cultivated computing talent only to lose it to a massive 'brain drain.' The heavy emphasis on software skills at IIT Kanpur aligned perfectly with the needs of American companies, which were rapidly expanding their software capabilities during the 1960s and 1970s. Often dubbed the 'Indian MIT,' IIT Kanpur produced graduates who transitioned seamlessly into American academia and industry. They became integral to U.S. institutions and projects, including Silicon Valley firms, government initiatives like the Census Bureau, and foundational computing projects such as ARPANET. This migration highlighted the structural weaknesses of India’s nascent computing industry, which lacked the resources and infrastructure to retain its talent. Consequently, IIT Kanpur graduates became key contributors to global computing innovation, albeit primarily outside India.

By 1972, even Norman Dahl of MIT, a key architect of the Kanpur assistance program, acknowledged its fundamental flaws. He conceded that while they had succeeded in producing skilled computer engineers and programmers, they had failed to consider where these talents would find employment after graduation, leading to the mass exodus:

'This situation results from the fact that thus far the IIT/K(anpur) has been an irrelevant factor in the industrial and social progress of India. At present the Institute is a kind of isolated island of academic excellence but not a part of the mainstream of India’s development... the faculty must make a change towards generating a new type of capital which is gathered not in terms of published papers or academic excellence but in terms of application of its intellectual capital to India’s problems. The IIT/K will not continue to receive special support from Indian society unless it also concerns itself with problems which matter to India. This is particularly true in the context of the new mood in the country of confidence and emphasis on self-reliance; IIT/K will have to earn any special treatment it receives.'

The 'new mood' of self-reliance that Dahl referenced represented more than nationalist sentiment—it embodied Bhabha and his TIFR colleagues’ comprehensive vision for Indian computing. This vision, inherited by Menon, centered on building domestic technological capabilities through public institutions. Their approach emphasized developing expertise in both hardware manufacturing and advanced research, viewing these as essential foundations for India's technological independence.

This vision stood in stark contrast to the model that had emerged at IIT Kanpur under IBM's influence. While IIT Kanpur successfully produced skilled programmers and computer scientists, its focus remained primarily on software development and computer usage rather than hardware innovation. The divergence between these two approaches, along with TIFR's growing influence over Indian government policy, would shape the coming confrontation between India's scientific establishment and IBM.
