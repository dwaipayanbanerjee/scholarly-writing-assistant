To counter IBM's market dominance, the Committee developed a clear, two-part strategy. They first advocated for significant government investment in versatile public computing systems that would serve multiple purposes, including theoretical research. Their second recommendation called for strong government backing of domestic manufacturing capabilities. Drawing from lessons learned during the TIFRAC project, the Committee faced a difficult reality: India's limited resources and technical capabilities made it impractical to manufacture all computer components domestically. Some international procurement was necessary.

The Committee established a crucial boundary: while parts could be imported, India must maintain control over "systems engineering"—the essential process of assembling and integrating these components. They understood that falling behind in advanced computer assembly expertise would be devastating. As they explicitly warned: "There would be no scope for building up domestic manufacturing potential in computer systems, no scope for employment in design and development of our engineers and scientists specializing in electronics and computer technology, and no scope for the utilization within the country of any sophisticated hardware produced by the domestic electronics industry." Each year of inaction, they cautioned, would compound these losses.

The combined insights from three pivotal reports—authored by Bhabha, Rao, and Narasimhan—delivered a stark message to India's government in the late 1960s. They argued that without decisive action, IBM's market control would confine India to two limiting roles: a software service provider for international firms and a dumping ground for outdated technology. The reports emphasized that in the fast-moving world of modern computing, immediate development of local technical expertise and manufacturing capacity was essential. The authors maintained that substantial investment in public computing infrastructure was the only viable path forward. They envisioned that once established, hardware manufacturing would both secure India's technological independence and create substantial economic benefits. This vision of technological self-reliance would soon find unexpected support beyond the scientific and policy community.
