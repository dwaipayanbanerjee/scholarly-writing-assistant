The installation of the IBM 1620 at IIT Kanpur catalyzed transformative developments in Indian industry, yet simultaneously underscored a critical paradox: India cultivated computing talent, only to lose it to a massive "brain drain."  IIT Kanpur’s emphasis on software skills aligned perfectly with the burgeoning needs of American companies in the 1960s and 70s.  Often called the "Indian MIT," IIT Kanpur's graduates transitioned seamlessly into American academia and industry, becoming integral to U.S. institutions, from Silicon Valley firms to government initiatives like the Census Bureau and foundational projects like ARPANET.  This migration highlighted the structural weaknesses within India’s nascent computing industry, which lacked the resources to retain its highly trained workforce. Consequently, while IIT Kanpur graduates became key contributors to global computing innovation, their contributions largely benefited entities outside India. 

By 1972, even Norman Dahl of MIT, a key architect of the Kanpur assistance program, acknowledged its flaws. He conceded their success in producing skilled computer engineers and programmers, but lamented their failure to consider future employment prospects, thus fueling the exodus:  "This situation results from the fact that thus far the IIT/K has been an irrelevant factor in the industrial and social progress of India. At present the Institute is a kind of isolated island of academic excellence but not a part of the mainstream of India’s development... the faculty must…generate a new type of capital…gathered not in terms of published papers or academic excellence but in terms of application of its intellectual capital to India’s problems. The IIT/K will not continue to receive special support…unless it also concerns itself with problems which matter to India. This is particularly true…in the context of the new mood in the country of confidence and emphasis on self-reliance; IIT/K will have to earn any special treatment it receives." 

This "new mood" of self-reliance transcended mere nationalist sentiment; it embodied Bhabha and his TIFR colleagues’ comprehensive vision for Indian computing. Inherited by Menon, this vision centered on building domestic technological capabilities through public institutions, emphasizing expertise in both hardware manufacturing and advanced research as foundations for India's technological independence. 

This vision contrasted sharply with the model emerging at IIT Kanpur under IBM's influence. While IIT Kanpur successfully produced skilled programmers and computer scientists, its focus remained primarily on software, not hardware innovation. This divergence, coupled with TIFR's growing influence over government policy, would shape the coming confrontation between India's scientific establishment and IBM.
