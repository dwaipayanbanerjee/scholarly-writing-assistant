  "prompt": "This book explores the early history of computing in India, charting the efforts made by its scientists and engineers to build a self-reliant computer industry. In the first two decades after independence, these pioneers aimed to position India as a significant global center for computing research and manufacturing. By the 1970s, this project seemed close to taking flight. Indian scientists and engineers were beginning to build computers that rivaled the best in the world, while the Indian government expelled IBM from the country because of the corporation\u2019s exploitative business practices. The goal was to establish public-sector led computer manufacturing, reducing dependency on foreign governments and multinational corporations. However, by the 1980s, just as this dream of self-reliant computing seemed within reach, it was abandoned in favor of an opposing vision: providing back-end labor for corporations headquartered in the Global North.",
