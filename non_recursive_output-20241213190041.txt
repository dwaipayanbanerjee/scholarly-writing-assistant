Many Indian scientists in that era first encountered a functional digital computer through the IBM 1620 at IIT Kanpur.  This installation, however, fundamentally deviated from TIFR's mission of cultivating domestic expertise. Historian Ross Bassett reveals how it strengthened U.S.-India computing ties, creating interlinkages between universities in both nations.  Simultaneously, Bassett argues, these very links unintentionally accelerated the "brain drain" of talented Indian computing professionals—the exact outcome Bhabha sought to prevent. This paradox, the simultaneous building and depletion of India's computing expertise by American technology, demands closer scrutiny.

The Kanpur project belonged to a broader strategy of international technical aid for India's elite engineering institutions.  Four new IITs formed strategic partnerships: IIT Bombay with the Soviet Union (1958), IIT Madras with West Germany (1959), IIT Kanpur with the United States (1960), and IIT Delhi with Britain (1963).  For IIT Kanpur, the partnership began in 1961 when three MIT professors met with director P. K. Kelkar. By the end of that year, nine American universities had joined the Indian and U.S. governments to create the Kanpur Indo-American Program, providing substantial financial and infrastructural support.

IIT Kanpur's computing decisions contrasted sharply with TIFR's focus on technological autonomy.  While TIFR’s scientists controlled their technological choices, at IIT Kanpur a US-led consortium dictated the computing systems.  Harry Huskey of UC Berkeley, a veteran of the ENIAC project, led the pivotal decision to partner with IBM, supported by Princeton's Forman Acton and Irving Rabinowitz.  This choice would profoundly influence Indian computing education for years to come.

Within months of the IBM 1620’s arrival, computing became integral to the IIT Kanpur undergraduate curriculum.  Led by two faculty members, V. Rajaraman and H. N. Mahabala—both trained in the United States through the Kanpur Indo-American Program—IIT Kanpur developed a comprehensive computer science curriculum. Rajaraman's 1969 textbook, affordably priced by design, became a defining resource for a generation of Indian programmers.
