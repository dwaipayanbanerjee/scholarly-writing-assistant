For many Indian scientists of that era, the IBM 1620 at IIT Kanpur represented their first hands-on experience with a functional digital computer. However, this installation signified a notable shift away from TIFR's mission of cultivating domestic expertise. Historian Ross Bassett highlights how the IIT Kanpur installation deepened U.S.-India computing ties, fostering connections between American universities and India. Yet, Bassett contends that these very connections had an unintended effect: they accelerated the "brain drain" of skilled Indian computing professionals, precisely the outcome Bhabha had aimed to avert. This paradox—where American technology simultaneously nurtured and eroded India's computing expertise—warrants close scrutiny. \n\nThe Kanpur project unfolded within a larger framework of international technical assistance to India's leading engineering institutions. Four of the newly established IITs forged strategic alliances with different nations: IIT Bombay collaborated with the Soviet Union in 1958, IIT Madras with West Germany in 1959, IIT Kanpur with the United States in 1960, and IIT Delhi with Britain in 1963. For IIT Kanpur in particular, the partnership took shape when three MIT professors met with director P. K. Kelkar in 1961. By the end of that year, nine American universities had joined the Indian and U.S. governments to launch the Kanpur Indo-American Program, offering significant financial and infrastructural support.
