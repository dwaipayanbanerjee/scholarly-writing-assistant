In 1967, P. V. S. Rao, formerly Narasimhan's deputy on the TIFRAC project, led a comprehensive study for the Electronics Committee. The committee, staffed mainly by TIFRAC veterans, expanded upon the Bhabha Report's findings. Their investigation validated TIFR's concerns about IBM's practices: the company consistently delayed releasing technology to India by four years after U.S. launches. This lag proved particularly problematic in computing, where new machine generations introduced incompatible software and operating systems.

The Rao Committee proposed decisive measures to address IBM's market control. They recommended limiting IBM's Indian operations unless the company partnered with Indian investors and stopped importing outdated technology. Their ambitious target aimed to reduce the technology gap from four years to one within five years. The committee emphasized building ferrite-core stringing plants—addressing TIFRAC's primary weakness in memory capacity. This initiative represented TIFR's second attempt at such a facility; earlier plans to establish a core-stringing plant in Bombay with Control Data Corporation (CDC) had failed after Bhabha's death.

The TIFR team also closely followed the Integrated Circuit (IC) revolution reshaping electronics manufacturing in Europe and the United States. These microchips—electronic circuits built on tiny semiconductor materials, typically silicon—enabled smaller devices with greater reliability at lower costs. After Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor developed the first viable ICs in 1958-1959, the Rao committee recognized their pivotal role in computing's future. They advocated establishing a regulated environment for domestic IC production, with carefully selected international partnerships.
