  "prompt": "This book delves into the early history of computing in India, tracing the efforts of its scientists and engineers to build a self-reliant computer industry. In the two decades following independence, these pioneers aimed to establish India as a global hub for computing research and manufacturing. By the 1970s, their vision seemed on the verge of becoming reality. Indian experts were crafting computers that rivaled the world's best, while the government expelled IBM for its exploitative practices. The goal? To create a public-sector-led computer industry, reducing reliance on foreign powers and multinational corporations. Yet, just as this dream of technological self-sufficiency appeared within grasp in the 1980s, it was surprisingly abandoned. In its place emerged a contrasting vision: positioning India as a back-end labor provider for corporations based in the Global North.\n\nWhat led to this change? Guided by a curiosity about this strange trajectory of computing in India, Computing in the Time of Decolonization answers three interconnected questions: What role did computing play in India\u2019s early postcolonial dreams of sovereignty? What challenges did the country\u2019s technocrats and scientists face in their pursuit of self-reliance, both in computing, and in broader scientific and technological research? And why did they ultimately abandon their original vision for self-reliance in these fields, in favor of allying with foreign technological monopolies? The answers to these questions illuminate the power dynamics within global computing today, especially the concentration of resources and expertise in a few corporations in the Global North.",
