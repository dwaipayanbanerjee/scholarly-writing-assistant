The IBM 1620 at IIT Kanpur introduced many Indian scientists of that era to their first working digital computer. However, this installation represented a significant shift from TIFR's goal of developing domestic expertise. Historian Ross Bassett shows how the IIT Kanpur installation enhanced U.S.-India computing relationships through connections between universities in both countries. Yet these same connections, Bassett notes, produced an unexpected result: they intensified the 'brain drain' of skilled Indian computing professionals abroadâ€”exactly what Bhabha had tried to prevent. This complex dynamic, where American technology simultaneously developed and diminished India's computing capabilities, deserves thorough analysis.

The Kanpur initiative was part of a larger framework of international technical assistance for India's leading engineering schools. Four new IITs established key partnerships with different countries: IIT Bombay with the Soviet Union (1958), IIT Madras with West Germany (1959), IIT Kanpur with the United States (1960), and IIT Delhi with Britain (1963). IIT Kanpur's collaboration began in 1961 when three MIT professors met with director P. K. Kelkar. Within that year, nine American universities joined forces with both governments to create the Kanpur Indo-American Program, offering extensive financial and infrastructural aid.
