The timing of IIT Kanpur's focus on software coincided with a pivotal moment in global migration. When IIT Kanpur's first class graduated in 1965, President Johnson's immigration reforms had just eased U.S. residency requirements for skilled workers from countries like India. These graduates, armed with advanced programming skills but facing limited opportunities in India's emerging computing sector, became highly attractive to U.S. institutions. U.S. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith's praise that 'of all the developments in India during the last few decades, Kanpur must have had the highest multiplier effect' carried an ironic undertone - this multiplier effect primarily benefited the United States, not India. As scholars Charles Leslie and Robert Kargon noted, IIT Kanpur contributed more significantly to American computing advancement than to India's technological development.

The IBM 1620's installation at IIT Kanpur highlighted a critical paradox: while catalyzing Indian technological education, it fueled a substantial 'brain drain.' The institution's software-focused curriculum perfectly matched American companies' needs during their rapid expansion in the 1960s and 1970s. IIT Kanpur, often called the 'Indian MIT,' produced graduates who easily integrated into American academia and industry, contributing to Silicon Valley, government projects, and pioneering initiatives like ARPANET. This exodus reflected the limitations of India's developing computing sector, which lacked the resources to retain its talent. As a result, IIT Kanpur's graduates drove computing innovation primarily beyond India's borders.

Nevertheless, IIT Kanpur significantly influenced India's emerging technology sector, particularly in the rise of outsourcing leaders like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys. TCS founder F.C. Kohli developed strong ties with IIT Kanpur, learning programming on its IBM systems. H. N. Mahabala, a faculty member, consulted for TCS, creating opportunities for graduates. Similarly, Infosys founder Narayana Murthy's first computing experience came from IIT Kanpur's IBM 1620, and he later leveraged MIT-trained Indian networks to build Infosys into a global force.

By 1972, Norman Dahl of MIT, who helped shape the Kanpur program, acknowledged its fundamental shortcomings. He admitted that while they succeeded in training skilled computer professionals, they had overlooked their post-graduation employment prospects, leading to widespread emigration. Dahl observed that IIT Kanpur had become 'an isolated island of academic excellence' disconnected from India's development needs, arguing that the institute needed to redirect its intellectual capital toward solving India's practical problems.

The 'new mood' of self-reliance Dahl referenced aligned with the comprehensive vision of Bhabha and his TIFR colleagues, later embraced by Menon. Their approach emphasized developing domestic technological capabilities through public institutions, focusing on both hardware manufacturing and advanced research as foundations for India's technological independence.

This vision contrasted sharply with IIT Kanpur's IBM-influenced model, which emphasized software development and computer usage over hardware innovation. The tension between these approaches, combined with TIFR's growing influence on government policy, would shape the upcoming clash between India's scientific establishment and IBM.
