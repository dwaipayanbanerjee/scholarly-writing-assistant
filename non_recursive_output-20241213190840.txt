The convergence of a narrow software focus at IIT Kanpur and a transformative shift in global migration set the stage for a complex interplay.  In 1965, as IIT Kanpur's inaugural class graduated, President Lyndon Johnson's landmark immigration reforms eased U.S. residency requirements for skilled workers, particularly from India.  These graduates, proficient programmers facing limited opportunities in India's nascent computing industry, became highly sought after by American universities and companies.  U.S. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith’s enthusiastic praise for IIT Kanpur—claiming its "multiplier effect" surpassed all other Indian developments—takes on new meaning in this context.  The unspoken reality: this multiplier effect largely benefited the United States, not India. Scholars Charles Leslie and Robert Kargon argue IIT Kanpur contributed significantly more to American computing than to India's own technological advancement.

Thus, the IBM 1620's installation at IIT Kanpur, while catalyzing developments in Indian industry, underscored a paradox: India cultivated computing talent, only to witness a massive "brain drain." IIT Kanpur's emphasis on software skills aligned perfectly with the burgeoning needs of American companies in the 1960s and 70s.  Often called the "Indian MIT," IIT Kanpur's graduates seamlessly transitioned into American academia and industry, becoming integral to Silicon Valley firms, government initiatives like the Census Bureau, and foundational projects like ARPANET. This migration highlighted the structural weaknesses of India's computing industry, which lacked the resources to retain its brightest minds. Consequently, IIT Kanpur graduates became key contributors to global computing innovation, albeit primarily outside India.

IIT Kanpur also played a pivotal role in the rise of global outsourcing giants like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys. TCS founder F.C. Kohli forged strong ties with IIT Kanpur, learning programming on its IBM systems.  Early on, IIT Kanpur faculty member H.N. Mahabala served as a summer consultant for TCS, establishing a pipeline for graduates.  Similarly, Infosys founder Narayana Murthy's first computing experience was on IIT Kanpur's IBM 1620. He later leveraged his network of MIT-trained Indian scientists to propel Infosys to global prominence.

By 1972, even Norman Dahl of MIT, a key architect of the Kanpur assistance program, acknowledged its flaws.  He conceded their success in producing skilled engineers and programmers was undermined by a failure to consider their future employment within India.  This oversight led to the mass exodus.  Dahl stated, "IIT/K(anpur) has been an irrelevant factor in India's progress.  It's an isolated island of academic excellence… The faculty must shift focus from published papers to applying intellectual capital to India's problems.  IIT/K must earn its special support by addressing issues that matter to India, particularly given the new mood of self-reliance." 

This "new mood" transcended mere nationalism; it embodied Bhabha and his TIFR colleagues' vision for Indian computing. Inherited by Menon, this vision centered on building domestic technological capabilities through public institutions, emphasizing both hardware manufacturing and advanced research as foundations for technological independence. This approach contrasted sharply with the software-centric model that emerged at IIT Kanpur under IBM's influence. While IIT Kanpur produced skilled programmers and computer scientists, it prioritized software over hardware innovation. This divergence, coupled with TIFR's growing policy influence, would shape the impending confrontation between India's scientific establishment and IBM.
